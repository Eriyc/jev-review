# Jev Review

Use `jev_review` for nontrivial coding work and `jev_signal` for a one-off file judgment. Jev scores supplied context; it does not read files, explain root causes, or edit code.

## Review loop

1. Understand the task, implement a coherent change, and run relevant checks.
2. Call `jev_review` with the task and current diff. Include complete relevant files or repository context when the diff alone is insufficient. This establishes a baseline.
3. Inspect weak important metrics and the code yourself. Scores, confidence, and rubric hints are signals, not diagnoses. Fix only a concrete issue with the smallest justified change.
4. Validate, then rescore the current implementation with the prior structured response unchanged as `previousEvaluation`. Compare per-metric movement; if a targeted score stays low, reconsider the diagnosis.
5. Repeat after meaningful changes while a justified fix remains. Stop when requirements and checks pass and further changes would add risk or complexity.

Do not repeat identical calls, review formatting-only changes, or change code merely to raise a score. Correctness and user requirements outrank Jev scores.

## Context and privacy

Keep review scope comparable across calls so score deltas are meaningful. Send the current diff, not an obsolete one; add tests, callers, or contracts needed to judge it. Do not send the whole repository by default. If Jev reports a token limit, remove unrelated content or split the review into coherent slices without hiding relevant evidence. `previousEvaluation` is compared locally.

The supplied context goes to the configured Jev provider. Never send secrets, environment files, generated or vendored code, or unrelated repository content.

## One-off file signal

Call `jev_signal` with file content, a specific yes/no `question`, clear `yesMeans` and `noMeans`, and relevant rules or neighboring context. Send the whole file when its structure matters and it fits. `evidenceProbability` estimates whether the supplied context supports the judgment. `probabilityYes` is a signal, not an automatic verdict; if it is `null`, supply more context before acting. Use tests or linters for mechanical rules.
